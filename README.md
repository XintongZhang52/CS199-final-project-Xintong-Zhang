Project Introduction
I plan to implement an asymmetric Encryption and decription algothirm. It should successfullly transfer text ciphered with a two-step encyption key. The seems like a project appropiate for fostering creativity and independent brain work.

Technical Overview
1. Settle the dependencies: In Cargo.toml, include libraries like rsa for RSA encryption and rand for secure random number generation.
2. Generate public and private encryption key, in the structure of asymmetric encryption
3. Encryption function
4. Decryption function
5. Input, output handling
By checkpoint1, I will try to complete settling dependencies, found a pattern for encryption key, and start on encryption funciton.
By check point2, I will try to finish the encryption function and work on decryption function.

Possible Challenges
It is the first time for me to implement a program in Rust using Visual Studio and crate interface.
For the program itself, challenges could include coming up with edge test cases to check if the program will run correctly, and communicate with users in a concise way of how the program works. 

References
This project took inspiration from classic symmetric and asymmetric encryption/decryption algothirms such as Vigenère Cipher, AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman).
